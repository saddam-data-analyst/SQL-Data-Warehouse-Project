## Project Requirments
### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two sources systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleans and resolve data quality issues prior to analytics.
- **Integration** : Combine Both sources into single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical quaries.

- These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision making,

## Data Architecture:
The data architeture for this project follows Medallion Architechture **Bronze**, **Silver**, **Gold** Layers
1.**Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2.**Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization and normalization processes t prepare data for analysis.
3.**Gold Layer** : Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required fro reporting and analysis.
